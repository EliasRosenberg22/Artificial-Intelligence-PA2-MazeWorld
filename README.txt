To run A* search with the Manhattan Distance and MazeWorldProblem.py
- run test_mazeworld.py by right-clicking on the test_mazeworld.py tab and clicking run.
- each maze is written in ASCII text and stored as a text file that is parsed by Maze.py
-A* search is generalized and held within astar_search.py and takes a search_problem (either MazeWorldProblem object or SensorlessProblem object) as well as a heuristic (Manhattan or Sensorless)

To run A* search with Sensorless Heuristic and SensorlessProblem.py
- run SensorlessProblem.py by right-clicking on the SensorlessProblem.py tab and clicking run.
- All of the test examples are run at the bottom of this py file, not in the test file set up for us. I was lazy and wanted it in the same place
- since there were less tests to run for this algorithm.
